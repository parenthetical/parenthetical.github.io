      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we argue that the essence of CRDTs is not about being &amp;ldquo;operation-based&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;state-based&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Instead, CRDTs have a more abstract meaning: they are ways to derive a value from a set of known operations.&#xA;These derivations follow a few simple patterns which can be reused to succinctly define the individual behaviors of a large catalog of CRDTs.&#xA;This means that when writing complex CRDTs it might be worth creating a little programming language which supports those patterns as first class primitives and implements them efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
