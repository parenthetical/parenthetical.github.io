      <description>In this paper we argue that the essence of CRDTs is not about being &amp;ldquo;operation-based&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;state-based&amp;rdquo;. Instead, CRDTs have a more abstract meaning: they are ways to derive a value from a set of known operations. These derivations follow a few simple patterns which can be reused to succinctly define the individual behaviors of a large catalog of CRDTs. This means that when writing complex CRDTs it might be worth creating a little programming language which supports those patterns as first class primitives and implements them efficiently.</description>

      <description>2023-03-19 I just remembered another useful FRP feature which currently doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. It would solve the &amp;ldquo;I wrote my program as a function of Event a, but I want it to accept input looking something like Event [a], where [a] is an ordered sequence of occurrences that have to happen &amp;ldquo;within the current moment&amp;rdquo;. Doing this safely, especially if you want to pass multiple of these Event [a] values to a program, seems tricky.</description>
