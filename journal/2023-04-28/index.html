I just watched Gilad Bracha&rsquo;s presentation on Ampleforth, a live-coding/literate programming/notebook/GUI environment. I loved how you could go from GUI element to definition, compose definitions and document any way you like, and how editing definitions is instantly reflected in the environment. What I think is missing is that in the markup elements are referred to by strings, so you have to think about naming objects if you want to refer to them.">

  <p>Back from hiatus for a few days.</p>
<p>I just watched Gilad Bracha&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORCYqykgWFI">presentation on Ampleforth</a>, a live-coding/literate programming/notebook/GUI environment.
I loved how you could go from GUI element to definition, compose definitions and document any way you like, and how editing definitions is instantly reflected in the environment.
What I think is missing is that in the markup elements are referred to by strings, so you have to think about naming objects if you want to refer to them.
A graphical environment is the perfect place to avoid this extra mental burden.</p>
<p>Otherwise I&rsquo;ve been working on understanding how FRP is implemented.
I wasn&rsquo;t able to make sense of all the things going on in <a href="https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex/">Reflex&rsquo;</a> implementation, so instead I&rsquo;m starting from Conal Elliott&rsquo;s <a href="http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/">Push-pull functional reactive programming</a> paper.
I&rsquo;m hoping that implementing the <em>Future</em> abstraction using techniques more similar to those of Reflex (graph traversals) is going to work.
The <code>reactive</code> library which came out of the push-pull paper never worked properly, and I&rsquo;m hoping that&rsquo;s because of the very experimental implementation techniques.</p>
<p>In any case, it would be nice if everything can be defined in terms of Futures; I want to experiment with different advanced uses of FRP and the simpler my implementation is the better.
If it&rsquo;s slower than Reflex that&rsquo;s not a big deal, anything is better than the semantic functions I&rsquo;ve been using up until now to experiment.</p>
