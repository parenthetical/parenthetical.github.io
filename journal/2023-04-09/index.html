<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NickSmit_/status/1563114360360222720">Nick Smith</a> linked his Twitter thread, which shared many of the same thoughts I&rsquo;m having, links to a paper: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3167107">&ldquo;The entangled strands of time in software development&rdquo;, Matthias Hauswirth and Mohammad Reza Azadmanesh 2017</a>.</p>
<p>This paper looks at what programmers need from their environment.</p>
<h3 id="time-travel-and-altering-the-past">Time travel &amp; altering the past</h3>
<p>On undo/redo resulting in a tree of history:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] keeping a mental model of the tree, and
one’s place in that tree when undoing and redoing, is too
taxing. After all, life is a sequence, not a tree. But then, life
doesn’t even have an undo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote makes it clear that making this tree user friendly is high priority if you want to build a system in which exploration is cost-free. Achieving this will make collaboration cost-free as well. Git has a hard time with this because of it&rsquo;s lowest common denominator text support.</p>
<p>Reading this makes me remember my interest in non-linear undo work.
I&rsquo;ve seen some older papers on this but I don&rsquo;t know how much it&rsquo;s supported in actual applications these days.
I wonder what a modern denotative approach looks like.</p>
<h3 id="source-and-documentation-navigation">Source &amp; documentation navigation</h3>
<p>This reminds me of how even with a functional programming you want identity and relations to be able to address things like looking up which functions refer to which etc.</p>
