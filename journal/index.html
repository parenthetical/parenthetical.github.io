<p>I just remembered another useful FRP feature which currently doesn&rsquo;t exist.
It would solve the &ldquo;I wrote my program as a function of <code>Event a</code>, but I want it to accept input looking something like <code>Event [a]</code>, where <code>[a]</code> is an ordered sequence of occurrences that have to happen &ldquo;within the current moment&rdquo;.
Doing this safely, especially if you want to pass multiple of these <code>Event [a]</code> values to a program, seems tricky.
You want to keep your &ldquo;moments within the current moment&rdquo; apart from other &ldquo;moments within the current moment&rdquo; because there would not necessarily be a relationship between them.</p>
<p>Maybe one way to achieve it would be something like the following, for which you need a source of first-class sub-time values.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nf">withMoments</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">Integer</span> <span class="c1">-- How many sub-moments to generate</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>(I didn&rsquo;t think about this signature properly.)</p>
<h3 id="code-metadata-version-coupling">Code metadata&ndash;version coupling</h3>
<p>Another &ldquo;what programming should be like&rdquo; thought:
I find it weird that <strong>TODOs/issues/&hellip;</strong> are not <strong>coupled to code</strong>.
Some people consider TODO/FIXME notes in the code itself a smell, but they are metadata about the code and I&rsquo;d like to see them while working on the code.</p>
<p>As far as I understand people are worried about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Untrackability of TODO in code.</li>
<li>A kind of fake &ldquo;technical debt accumulation&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s too easy to add TODOs.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand I think I&rsquo;ve seen technical debt accumulation precisely because TODOs were not added.
The same little niggles were present all over the code base but no one kept track of them and it kept making things worse.</p>
<h2 id="2023-03-18">2023-03-18</h2>
<p>Rather than immediately attempt my own implementation of FRP, I&rsquo;ve been working on understanding Reflex&rsquo; Spider implementation.
I started out with the original codeâ€”randomly deleting anything that didn&rsquo;t seem essential like <code>Incremental</code> and <code>Dynamic</code> (because they can be expressed in terms of <code>Event</code> and <code>Behavior</code>), but it seems that <code>Dynamic</code> might be a basic building block of the implementation? Maybe the way behaviors work is actually via something Dynamic-like?</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve re-copied the whole Reflex implementation and I&rsquo;m now simplifying with the help of Git.
First I&rsquo;m deleting all debugging stuff behind the <code>DEBUG*</code> flags, next I&rsquo;ll see about deleting some things like <code>fan</code> which are just optimizations.</p>
<p>I think understanding what &ldquo;height&rdquo; is and what the goals of all the &ldquo;deferral queues&rdquo; are is a major step in understanding.</p>
<h2 id="2023-03-13">2023-03-13</h2>
<p>I started working on an implementation of Reflex-like FRP in Haskell.
I&rsquo;ve long wondered how it all works and not understanding the internals has held me back from understanding what goes wrong when my mad experiments fail.
I&rsquo;m taking this as an opportunity to learn about <a href="https://input-output-hk.github.io/haskell.nix/index.html">haskell.nix</a> as well.</p>
<p>Things I&rsquo;d like to explore with this implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>Now</code> monad which has
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">occurs</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">Event</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Now</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Maybe</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li>Experiment with first-class timelines.
(Needs keeping the flexibility of Reflex&rsquo; parameterized types.)</li>
<li>Maybe focus on commutative-first operations? I&rsquo;ve long thought that sequential-first over commutative-first is a mistake in library design, and Haskell suffers from it. (Another way to see this is &ldquo;sets over lists&rdquo;.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2023-03-12">2023-03-12</h2>
<p>I started reading Ink and Switch&rsquo;s article on their <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/upwelling/">Upwelling project</a>.
I&rsquo;m really enjoying it so far and I&rsquo;m excited to see other people are sharing my thoughts on how collaboration tools should work.</p>
<h2 id="2023-03-10">2023-03-10</h2>
<p>More thoughts and questions:</p>
<h3 id="smalltalk-y-environments-and-distributed-programming">SmallTalk-y environments and distributed programming</h3>
<p>Why does it feel like SmallTalk environments don&rsquo;t do so well for distributed programming? (Pure ignorance here, maybe they do.) Does any &ldquo;more than text&rdquo; environment do well?</p>
<h3 id="concrete-examples-vs-abstractions">Concrete examples vs abstractions</h3>
<p>I listened to the FoC podcast episode on Magic Ink. In it the thought comes up that design tools should work via concrete examples instead of starting with abstractions, like &ldquo;normal&rdquo; programming does. This may sound like it&rsquo;s in opposition to the category-abstract-as-much-as-we-can vibes we have in the FP community, but I believe it&rsquo;s actually extremely compatible, even necessary. The thing that&rsquo;s missing is a database of concrete examples and a user friendly interface.</p>
<p>A programming environment should say &ldquo;you have two numbers, here are the combinators that work on them&rdquo;.
It should then save the chosen combinator both as a concrete one and as a more abstract monoidal operation.
If the code changes and you e.g. switch from numbers to matrices it should pick a new sensible operation or ask if multiple exist.</p>
<h3 id="undo-via-timeline-of-actions-manipulation">Undo via timeline-of-actions manipulation</h3>
<p>My master&rsquo;s thesis was about making timelines/events in FRP first class values which can be modified, and using that to implement things like undo.
I think this is a concept which should be explored more, and which would render an FRP-based programming environment super useful, because you could ask &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; questions and have a much better interactive development/debugging experience.</p>
<h3 id="causality-of-actions-why-can-this-happen">Causality of actions, &ldquo;why can this happen?&rdquo;</h3>
<p>When thinking of implementing undo functionality with the above timeline-of-actions concept one of the first problems which comes to mind is deleting an action which makes future actions meaningless.
E.g. if in a drawing program you remove the action which created a circle, then later actions resizing that circle no longer make sense.
Can we invent a programming language in which it is easy to ask &ldquo;which parts of the future exist only because of this thing which happened in the past?&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="ui-designs-programs-should-be-testable">UI designs/programs should be testable</h3>
<p>Could you record interactions with a UI and replay them in various contexts (resized windows etc.) so that they still work?
This needs predictable identifiers for the UI components.
What does a programming language which natively supports these predictable IDs look like?</p>
<p>In common OO programming object identity is not predictable, because the system is not pure and not replayable.</p>
<h2 id="2023-02-25">2023-02-25</h2>
<p>I think it would be good to have a list of projects I&rsquo;m (considering) working listed on my web site.
Things I can think of right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play around with making Obelisk composable (components with frontend, backend, and database)</li>
<li>Finish my &ldquo;distributed FRP&rdquo; paper? I got a demotivated and burnt out on this tbh.</li>
<li>Blog post about denotative distributed programming.</li>
<li>Trying to find an amazing implementation of Paxos in a toy distributed FRP implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2023-02-24">2023-02-24</h2>
<p>Thoughts I wrote down during my Fisherman&rsquo;s Trail walk:</p>
<h3 id="debuggers-should-work-on-different-semantic-levels">Debuggers should work on different semantic levels</h3>
<p>For example, an FRP debugger should tell you &ldquo;what is true at time <em>t</em>&rdquo; (values of behaviors, any event occurrences).
If say you wrote an infinite recursion in the non-FRP code, you should be able to drop down to a friendly execution model for that code.</p>
<h3 id="why-couldn-t-smalltalk-be-a-purely-functional-programming-environment-why-not-an-frp-inspired-smalltalk">Why couldn&rsquo;t Smalltalk be a purely functional programming environment? Why not an FRP-inspired Smalltalk?</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;d need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A model of how the program definition changes over time.</li>
<li>A precise, composable, and easy to understand of where the state of
objects comes from. Smalltalk OO gives identitiy to everything with
state, but maybe that&rsquo;s overkill and we can make identity explicit
in a natural way.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="when-developing-guis-you-should-be-able-to-ask-questions-and-edit-live">When developing GUIs you should be able to ask questions and edit live</h3>
<ul>
<li>How is this element defined?</li>
<li>Where does it come from?</li>
<li>Why does it exist/am I seeing it?</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, you should be able to enter a special mode while developing which allows you to click on a button and be taken to its editable definition.
Editing that definition should either change that button (like the DOM editor in your browser) or all buttons (but that might render the current state impossible to reach?).
Other things which would be cool is to know the causality of the button&rsquo;s existence. E.g. which other buttons were pressed in the past to get to where we are?</p>
<h3 id="why-can-t-state-and-code-evolve-together-textual-programming-is-such-a-dead-end-dot">Why can&rsquo;t state and code evolve together? Textual programming is such a dead end.</h3>
<p><span class="org-target" id="org-target--state-code-evolve-together-log"></span>
I was recently helping a friend with a Python project and we had to use a variable to store some text that we&rsquo;d modify later in the program.
She was surprised to learn that this wouldn&rsquo;t change the text in the source code as well.
I had to tell her that this was a reasonable assumption but that the field of programming was not yet ready for her futuristic ideas :&rsquo;).</p>
<p>This really begs the question &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t state and code evolve together?&rdquo;
The two are intimately linked.
One version of the state might only make sense for one particular version of the code.
The only reason I can think of why carrying state between versions of a program tends to work is because we explicitly name bits of state, e.g. with database tables.
These are usually globally unique identifiers which kills composition.</p>
<p>To make code-state-coevolution feasible you&rsquo;d have to be able to do operations like &ldquo;start over with fresh state&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This coevolution problem seems extremely hard to solve with a plain text editor.
You really want to have program-and-state history as a branchable, rewritable, &hellip; history.
Just like we do now with Git.
I can&rsquo;t see that happening unless the editor really understands what&rsquo;s happening, and when you have that you might as well add a lot more UI to &ldquo;code&rdquo;.</p>
<p>How would you write a document editor in which the document is defined as an exportable program but is no different from code?
In which you can define in-line editing interfaces for the document elements?
This is just Smalltalk-like stuff IIRC.
&ldquo;Bring Smalltalk back?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="2023-02-22">2023-02-22</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d really like to find out how a library like Reflex works. I also just found out that browsers support weak references and finalizers in JavaScript now, so I think that means Reflex Spider-style implementations can now be done in JS.</p>
<p>IIRC something that&rsquo;s expensive in Reflex is to know whether <code>Event (Event a)</code> has a simultaneous occurrence.
Another expensive thing is joining Dynamic (because of the previous simultaneous nested event occurrence thing?).
Why are they so in the current Reflex implementation?</p>
<p>Random thought: it would be cool if an implementation supported</p>

Now you only have <code>sample</code> for behaviors, but not the equivalent for dynamics.</p>
