  <p>More thoughts and questions:</p>
<h2 id="smalltalk-y-environments-and-distributed-programming">SmallTalk-y environments and distributed programming</h2>
<p>Why does it feel like SmallTalk environments don&rsquo;t do so well for distributed programming? (Pure ignorance here, maybe they do.) Does any &ldquo;more than text&rdquo; environment do well?</p>
<h2 id="concrete-examples-vs-abstractions">Concrete examples vs abstractions</h2>
<p>I listened to the FoC podcast episode on Magic Ink. In it the thought comes up that design tools should work via concrete examples instead of starting with abstractions, like &ldquo;normal&rdquo; programming does. This may sound like it&rsquo;s in opposition to the category-abstract-as-much-as-we-can vibes we have in the FP community, but I believe it&rsquo;s actually extremely compatible, even necessary. The thing that&rsquo;s missing is a database of concrete examples and a user friendly interface.</p>
<p>A programming environment should say &ldquo;you have two numbers, here are the combinators that work on them&rdquo;.
It should then save the chosen combinator both as a concrete one and as a more abstract monoidal operation.
If the code changes and you e.g. switch from numbers to matrices it should pick a new sensible operation or ask if multiple exist.</p>
<h2 id="undo-via-timeline-of-actions-manipulation">Undo via timeline-of-actions manipulation</h2>
<p>My master&rsquo;s thesis was about making timelines/events in FRP first class values which can be modified, and using that to implement things like undo.
I think this is a concept which should be explored more, and which would render an FRP-based programming environment super useful, because you could ask &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; questions and have a much better interactive development/debugging experience.</p>
<h2 id="causality-of-actions-why-can-this-happen">Causality of actions, &ldquo;why can this happen?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>When thinking of implementing undo functionality with the above timeline-of-actions concept one of the first problems which comes to mind is deleting an action which makes future actions meaningless.
E.g. if in a drawing program you remove the action which created a circle, then later actions resizing that circle no longer make sense.
Can we invent a programming language in which it is easy to ask &ldquo;which parts of the future exist only because of this thing which happened in the past?&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="ui-designs-programs-should-be-testable">UI designs/programs should be testable</h2>
<p>Could you record interactions with a UI and replay them in various contexts (resized windows etc.) so that they still work?
This needs predictable identifiers for the UI components.
What does a programming language which natively supports these predictable IDs look like?</p>
<p>In common OO programming object identity is not predictable, because the system is not pure and not replayable.</p>
