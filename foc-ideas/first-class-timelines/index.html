<p>Having an FRP implementation in which timelines (Events) are manipulable allows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording user interaction as actions, rather than states, and allowing the user to replay or manipulate them.</li>
<li>Implementing Undo/Redo by treating the timeline as a stack you push and pop from.</li>
<li>Implementing Non-Linear Undo by deleting arbitrary events. Doing this well requires knowing which future actions depend on which actions in the past however. E.g. You don&rsquo;t want to leave actions that move a circle that was never drawn.</li>
<li>Implementing advanced and subtle user interactions such as &ldquo;tapping takes into account the users reaction time&rdquo;, i.e. if the screen suddenly changes the tap applies to what was there a hundred milliseconds before.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Arbitrary timeline editing requires an incremental implementation of FRP if you don&rsquo;t want to replay all of history.
This means that an implementation should focus on using associative, and preferably commutative, folds.</p>
